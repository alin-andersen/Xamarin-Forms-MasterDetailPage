# Xamarin-Forms-MasterDetailPage
Alternative implementation for MasterDetailPage by Alin Andersen. Useable, but still in development.
Not tested nor implemented on iOS (because I don't have any Apple machines).

| Example master view  | Example detail page |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ![Example master view](Assets/MasterView.jpg) | ![Example detail page](Assets/DetailPage.jpg) |

| Mix between master view and detail page  | Works even on the right side of the screen |
